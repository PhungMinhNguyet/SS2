A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.\r\n\r\nPseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user \"points to\" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6]\r\n\r\nSelectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are in elements of class myClass.\r\n\r\nThe following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced it.[8]', 1, '2020-05-28 10:29:59', 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRLaaSrgqOQx9zSJBMARm44guLaqO2lUpwWyok2ls6G0iYkG6Io&usqp=CAU'),
(2, 1, 1, 'History of Google', 'Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of the Big Four technology companies alongside Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.[10][11][12]\r\n\r\nGoogle was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a California privately held company on September 4, 1998, in California. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002.[13] An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet\'s leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet\'s Internet interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe company\'s rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google\'s core search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Duo, Hangouts, Meet), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, Street View), video sharing (YouTube), note-taking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the Google Pixel smartphone, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber, Google Fi, and Google Station).[14]\r\n\r\nGoogle.com is the most visited website in the world.[15] Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube and Blogger. Google was the most valuable brand in the world in 2017 (surpassed by Amazon)[16], but has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust,

(3, 1, 1, 'History of Facebook', 'Facebook is an American online social media and social networking service based in Menlo Park, California and a flagship service of the namesake company Facebook, Inc. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.\r\n\r\nThe founders initially limited Facebook membership to Harvard students. Membership was expanded to Columbia, Stanford, and Yale before being expanded to the rest of the Ivy League, MIT, and higher education institutions in the Boston area, then various other universities, and lastly high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students.\r\n\r\nFacebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which is shared with any other users that have agreed to be their \"friend\", or, with a different privacy setting, with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join common-interest groups, buy and sell items or services on Marketplace, and receive notifications of their Facebook friends\' activities and activities of Facebook pages they follow. Facebook claimed that it had more than 2.3 billion monthly active users as of December 2018.\r\n\r\nFacebook has been subject to extensive media coverage and many controversies. These often involve user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections), psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and content that some users find objectionable, including fake news, conspiracy theories, and copyright infringement. Commentators have accused Facebook of helping to spread false information and fake news. In 2017, Facebook partnered with fact checkers from the Poynter Institute\'s International Fact-Checking Network to identify and mark false content, though most ads from political candidates are exempt from this program.

Clearly understanding the importance of coding, Zuckerberg’s father Edward taught him Atari BASIC computer programming. It didn’t take long for his skills to become apparent. When he was 11, his parents hired a software developer named David Newman to tutor him. Newman to this day calls Zuckerberg a “prodigy”.\r\n\r\nWithin a couple of years, Zuckerberg created an incredibly practical programme: ZuckNet. His father ran a dentists out of the house and wanted a simple way for the receptionist to contact him without shouting through their home. ZuckNet, which worked like an internal instant messaging system, did just that.\r\n\r\nWhile attending Phillips Exeter Academy, an elite boarding school, his drive to create did not abate. He attracted interest from AOL and Microsoft. The wanted to buy Synapse, a piece of software that learned a user’s music taste through AI and listening habits he created with a friend, and give him a job.\r\n\r\nUltimately, he turned it down and set his sites on Harvard. It’s here where the origins of Facebook can be found. It’s a decision he unlikely regrets now.\r\n\r\nHarvard and Facemash\r\n\r\nHaving turned down two of the biggest tech companies in the world, Zuckerberg headed off to Harvard in 2002. Clearly he had bigger plans. He chose to major in psychology, but took plenty of computer science classes along with it. At first the psychology choice seems strange. Why not major in programming or something similar?\r\n\r\nBut when you think of Facebook’s nature, the supposed ‘addictive’ nature of the likes, comments, and pokes, the psychology part becomes clearer. Facebook from the off pulls you in to share personal details and seek out interaction from other people. Being able to design something like this must involve some knowledge of the human mind.\r\n\r\nZukerberg attracts his first big controversy in October, 2003. He creates and published Facemash, a website that lets Harvard students judge the attractiveness of each other to create rankings (similar to the Hot or Not site that launched in 2000). As he didn’t actually get permission to use student photos, unsurprisingly many were not happy with his work.\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours the site had seen 22k photo views, but within a few days it was shut down. He was hauled in front of the Harvard Administration Board. With the risk of expulsion on the table, the board finally decided to let him stay. After a public apology he moved on from his first brush with authority and set his sights on his next project.', 1, '2020-05-28 22:16:54', 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQP4QxcvzmFKYR6CFFu7jAOrzmAz0cDU-DcZkRgZDoq5pwL6y95&usqp=CAU'),

Over 200 million shares changed hands in these transactions.\r\n\r\nThe put-through price was much higher than VHM’s order-matched closing price this session, which was VND70,000 ($3) per share, down 6.7 percent over the previous session.\r\n\r\nMonday marked HoSE’s second highest liquidity trading session in the past 20 years and the highest this year. Back in May 18, 2018, foreign investors had also bought up a large amount of VHM shares, pushing the liquidity of HoSE to a record of VND34.92 trillion ($1.51 billion).\r\n\r\nThe VN-Index, based on the performance of HoSE stocks, plummeted 3.6 percent, or 31.05 points to 832.47 points, its third losing session in a row.

And you could think, well, maybe, now that he’s closing in on his 33rd birthday, that might actually be the case. You’d be wrong yet again.\r\n\r\nJust like fine wine, a vintage car or a priceless artefact, Messi is seemingly getting better with age and you can clearly see in the way he moves, controls the ball, creates and above all, scores the goals. The numbers prove it too – Messi is having another unstoppable season.\r\n\r\nA total of 21 goals and 14 assists in 24 games played in LaLiga certainly prove as much and that’s also with almost two months spent on the sidelines due to two different injuries. Quite clearly, and yet again, the Argentine is well above the norm.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nKarim Benzema’s brace against Valencia the other night brought him a little bit closer to the top but Leo is still ahead and the race for the Pichichi is once again in his hands.\r\n\r\nBut Barcelona’s grand finale to the 2019/20 season is anything but easy. In fact, looking at the schedule, it has ‘drama‘ written all over it and everything starts with tonight’s trip to Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán where Sevilla, currently the third-placed team, await the Azulgranas.\r\n\r\nJulen Lopetegui has a formidable squad at his disposal and Quique Setién may need a bit of magic to get all three points tonight.

(7, 1, 1, 'History of Java', 'The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.\r\n\r\nThe principles for creating Java programming were \"Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic\". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early \'90s.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. There are given significant points that describe the history of Java.\r\n\r\n1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.\r\n2) Initially designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.\r\n3) Firstly, it was called \"Greentalk\" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.\r\n4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.\r\nWhy Java named \"Oak\"?\r\n5) Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.\r\n6) In 1995, Oak was renamed as \"Java\" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.\r\nWhy Java Programming named \"Java\"?\r\n7) Why had they chosen java name for Java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were \"dynamic\", \"revolutionary\", \"Silk\", \"jolt\", \"DNA\", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.\r\nAccording to James Gosling, \"Java was one of the top choices along with Silk\". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.\r\n8) Java is an island of Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office.\r\n9) Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.\r\n10) Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.\r\n11) In 1995, Time magazine called Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995.\r\n12) JDK 1.0 released in(January 23, 1996). After the first release of Java, there have been many additional features added to the language. Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications, enterprise applications, mobile applications, cards, etc. Each new version adds the new features in Java.\r\n\r\nJava Version History\r\nMany java versions have been released till now. The current stable release of Java is Java SE 10.\r\n1. JDK Alpha and Beta (1995)\r\n2. JDK 1.0 (23rd Jan 1996)\r\n3. JDK 1.1 (19th Feb 1997)\r\n4. J2SE 1.2 (8th Dec 1998)\r\n5.

(8, 1, 1, 'The History Of Robotics', 'Robotics is a branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation and application of robots and autonomous systems, as well as the computer systems that power such devices, including control, sensory feedback and information processing.\r\n\r\nRobots are typically designed as automated machines that can take the place of humans. Most robotic machines can be seen in manufacturing lines, such as widely used in the auto industry. Robots are also utilized to replace humans in dangerous situations. One example would be to send an automated machine into a burning building to hunt for survivors when it may too dangerous to send in firefighters. Another example would be the utilization of a robot by SWAT to search a crime scene for dangerous persons or explosives.\r\n\r\nThe term robotics is derived from the word robot, which was first introduced by Czech writer Karel Capek in his 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots). The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means labor. In Capek’s play, it begins in a factory where artificial robotic people (similar to the modern idea of androids) are being built. Capek maintained that the word robot was not of his own origin, noting it actually came from his brother Josef. He explained this in a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary.\r\n\r\nAccording to that dictionary, the word robotics was first used in print by Isaac Asimov in his short story “Liar!,” published in May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction. Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term, believing that robotics was already referred to as the science and technology of robots. Asimov later wrote that the word robotics was first used in another of his short stories, “Runaround,” published in 1942 in Astounding Science Fiction. However, Oxford English Dictionary referred to “Liar!” as the origination of the term as it was published five months before “Runaround.”\r\n\r\nROBOTIC CONCEPT\r\n\r\nThe concept of robotics has actually been around much longer, with evidence of the concept appearing as early as the third century BC.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest descriptions of automata appears in the Lie Zi text, telling of a much earlier encounter between King Mu of Zhou (1023-957 BC) and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, who allegedly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical handiwork.\r\n\r\nArchytas of Tarentum built a wooden, steam-propelled bird in 420 BCE, which was reportedly able to fly. In 1206 AD, inventor Al-Jazari created the first early humanoid automata. The first designs for a humanoid robot surfaced in 1495, when Leonardo da Vinci created a mechanical knight. In 1898, Nikola Tesla demonstrated the first radio-controlled vessel, the teleautomaton.\r\n\r\nElektro, developed by Westinghouse Electric Corp., became the first humanoid robot to be exhibited to the public, shown at the 1939 and 1940 World’s Fairs. In 1948, Elsie Elmer and William Grey Walter developed the first robots to exhibit biological behavior. George Devol created the first commercial robot, Unimate, in 1956, which became the first installed industrial robot in 1961.\r\n\r\nABB Robot Group introduced the world’s first microcomputer-controlled electric industrial robot, called IRB 6, in 1974. The robot was delivered to a small mechanical engineering company in Sweden. That robot was patented since 1972. Victor Scheinman introduced the first programmable universal manipulation arm in 1975.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\r\n\r\nAlong with robotics, came the concept of artificial intelligence (AI), which is nearly as old in concept as the idea of robotics.\r\n\r\nThe actual field of AI research, however, did not come into being until 1956 during a conference at Dartmouth College. The attendees of this conference went on to become the leaders of AI research for decades. By the mid-1960s, research in AI was heavily funded by the US Department of Defense and laboratories around the world were later established to work on AI. The advances of the time led Herbert Simon, one of the original Dartmouth conference attendees, to theorize that robotic machines could, within 20 years, take over for man in the workplace.\r\n\r\nHowever, while part of his prophecy was realized, being that robotic machines did become prominent fixtures in factory lines by the 1970s, they lacked true artificial intelligence. In 1974, in response to heavy criticism from Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from Congress, researchers ultimately cut off all exploratory research in AI. The period following this transition was later known as “AI Winter,” a period when funding for AI research was nearly non-existent.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the early 1980s, AI research made a comeback due to the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI research reached more than a billion dollars, with Japan leading the way in research and technology. This inspired US and British governments to return to the field of AI research. But the collapse of the Lisp machine market in 1987 once again hurt AI research, leading to an even longer AI Winter period.\r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, AI research was once again revived and it achieved its greatest successes in the early part of the 21st century, albeit in a behind-the-scenes manner. AI became prominent fixtures in logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis and many other areas in the technology industry. With that success, AI research once again was catapulted into the limelight and new fields were developed revolving around AI and robotic systems.\r\n\r\nROBOTICS BEYOND 2000\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Carnegie Mellon’s Hans Moravec coined a new term, “Generation Robots,” which was used to describe the level of advancement of robots. Moravec predicted in 1997 that first-generation robots should carry the intelligence of lizards by 2010. First-gen robots would be incapable of learning, however, leading to the rise of second-gen robots, which have the intelligence comparable to that of a mouse and be available by 2020. He went on to say third-gen robots should have the intelligence of monkeys and fourth-gen robots with the intelligence of humans. Moravec predicted human AI in robots would be possible by 2040-2050.\r\n\r\nToday, robotics can be broken down into dozens of subfields and includes everything from biomechanics to nanoengineering and artificial intelligence to behavioral science.\r\n\r\nRobots have come a long way since the early days of robotic innovation. We now have robots in our workplaces, robots in our homes, and even robots on the International Space Station. And with technological advancements improving every day, it is likely we will see robots that can think, act and evolve on their own someday soon.', 2, '2020-06-22 14:06:00', 'https://compote.slate.com/images/a6b35da5-5dbd-43c6-b554-a3960ab683f3.jpg');

Just think about sites and apps like Facebook, Netflix, and Instagram for example. It’s exactly frameworks that are responsible for their uninterrupted operation by providing and giving their users a complete experience.\r\n\r\nWe can define a framework, most simply, as a large number of pre-built components which give developers the ability to expand and customize them depending on the application they make. Most frameworks have source language JavaScript.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind, above all, the continuous technological development, the needs of the users of the web and mobile applications, and the tendency of the front-end developers to enable them, the topic of this article is the most popular frameworks. In this article, I analyze the six best frameworks according to their performances and popularity.\r\n\r\n1. React.js\r\nReact is a JavaScript component-based library with JSX syntax.\r\n\r\nFacebook software engineer Jordan Walke created the prototype for React in response to common problems in the work of Facebook app caused by expansion of the network. Officially, its first application by Facebook gets in 2011 and two years after that, 2013, it becomes an open sourced library.   \r\n\r\nThe main characteristic of React is a virtual DOM, but necessary to mention that it is 1-way data binding. Thanks to the virtual DOM characteristic, React is characterized by exceptional performance.  \r\n\r\nFrom the aspect of the level of difficulty, React is one of the easiest to learn, especially compared to Angular.\r\n\r\nWhere is it used? React focuses on building a UI of a single page web app (SAP) and mobile app. Since React is a library, it is necessary to include several other libraries for the development of more complex applications, from which I would specify Redux and React Router. Also, React Native is an additional platform for building high-quality iOS and Android App.  \r\n\r\nKnown for its high-performance, React has proved extremely demanding for applications that require dynamics, often upgrades and updates. That’s enough to say about React because Instagram implemented it after Facebook.\r\n\r\nHow popular it is?\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to React’s popularity, I will look at GitHub statistics. According to current data, it has 122,529 stars, and in the past year, the average growth of stars per day is 93. This library became popular and widely accepted in a relatively short time. For sure it represents a trend and, the community is rapidly growing.  \r\n\r\nBig projects/companies that use?\r\n\r\nExcept for the company I mentioned before, React is the choice of Netflix, New York Times, Yahoo! Mail, Vivaldi Browser, Dropbox, PayPal, Pinterest, Timber, Uber, and many other apps.\r\n\r\nProsMaintained by Facebook,\r\nThe community is constantly evolving,\r\nVirtual DOM,\r\nHight performance,\r\nSuitable for applications with high traffic,\r\nOften updated,\r\nCons\r\n\r\nNot SEO friendly,\r\nNeeds other libraries to build more complex applications\r\n\r\n2. Angular\r\nExtremely popular framework Angular is the only one on this list whose source language is TypeScript.\r\n\r\nThe Google team developed it to upgrade the earlier version of AngularJS. In the focus of development, on the one hand, there was the fulfillment of modern demands, talking about technology, and, on the other hand, the tendency to combine the concepts that best showed in practice. With this framework, the Google team has undoubtedly set standards in this sphere. They published the first version of Angular (v2) in 2016. Before that, in 2014 and 2015 were released alpha and beta.\r\n\r\nAngular is a component-based framework, but unlike React, it is a 2-way data binding.\r\n\r\nLearning Angular is difficult although the documentation and community are very numerous. The documentation is even more confusing, especially for beginners.\r\n\r\nWhere is it used?\r\n\r\nAngular is used to develop web and mobile apps. In addition to the standard use of a single page app with the proper library, like for example Universal, it is possible to create a multi-page app. As regards mobile applications, they committed Google to give users with an exceptional Ionic platform focused on the development of the Native app and Progressive Web Applications.\r\n\r\nHow popular is it?\r\n\r\nAt GitHub Angular, there are 45,376 stars at the moment, and in the past year, the average number of stars per day is 33. An interesting fact is that the number of stars is falling in comparison with the React that is growing. Angular has been extremely popular in the programming community for many years and now has the largest one.\r\n\r\nBig projects/companies that use it?\r\n\r\nApart from Google, Angular also uses Microsoft Office Home, Forbes, Blender Video, Xbox, Santander Bank and BMW. ProsStrong community,\r\n2-way data binding,\r\nSimple single page app,\r\nShadow DOM,\r\nTypescript,\r\nCons\r\n\r\nComplex and not easy to learn,\r\nMust learn Typescript\r\n\r\n3. AngularJS\r\nAngularJS comes from the earlier described Angular which source language is JavaScript. So, AngularJS is the first version that was developed by two exceptional developers Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons, published in 2009. With its appearance, AngularJS quickly gained popularity in professional web development. This framework is a 2-way data binding.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difference between this framework and the earlier one is for sure in the source language, but also in the characteristics and purposes. They did not base AngularJS on today’s concept of a modern framework but is undoubtedly responsible for the development of the same, Angular.\r\n\r\nAlso, AngularJS has an MVC (Model – View – Controller) architecture.\r\n\r\nWhere is it used?\r\n\r\nAngularJS is primarily designed to build dynamic web applications. Suitable for single-page applications. However, it does not support construe of mobile apps as its successor.\r\n\r\nHow popular is it?\r\n\r\nThis framework has a total of 59,379 stars on GitHub. The annual average falls so that the star rating per day is about 3.7. It is a standard case of circumstance if we consider the appearance of Angular, which is a significantly improved version.\r\n\r\nBig projects/companies that use it?\r\n\r\nSome of the companies, or sites, that are built with AngularJS are Google Gmail, Upwork, The Guardian, HBO, Sony, General Motors, Weather.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\nJavaScript friendly compared to Angular\r\n2-way data binding,\r\nFast development,\r\nHighly testable applications\r\nConsDifficult to learn,\r\nOld version,\r\nLow popularity\r\n\r\n4. Vue.js\r\nAnother framework which has gained immense popularity lately is Vue.js. Vue does not have the support of large companies, unlike the previous ones,  and was developed by Evan You, the man who took part in the development of AngularJS. First launched in 2014.\r\n\r\nVue is a component-based and visual DOM, which makes it very fast. Another important feature is that it has a significantly smaller size compared to React and Angular. Also, this framework is 1-way-binding same as React.  \r\n\r\nWhat makes Vue unique and what I need to emphasize, it is one of the most straightforward JavaScript frameworks. His creator’s efforts to make it as simpler as possible influenced this, to change the complex concept that AngularJS has. Vue is a beginner friendly with detailed documentation and a growing community.\r\n\r\nHow popular is it?\r\n\r\nIt is fascinating that Vue is becoming a trend in the front-end development community without the names of large and well-known companies behind it. A simple structure and ease of integration must undoubtedly overwrite his popularity.\r\n\r\nStatistically, Vue has 128,158 stars on GitHub and 121 stars/year and its community are growing every day. At the time of writing the article at the daily level, he had 102 stars.\r\n\r\nWhere is it used?\r\n\r\nThis framework has a wide purpose, from web applications to mobile and PWA. Similar to React it is suitable for different types of projects, from simple single page applications to the more complex and dynamic ones. Mainly uses Weex framework to develop a mobile app. Except for the high performance and simplicity that its main features, Vue has the support of numerous components that further increase its potential.\r\n\r\nBig projects/companies that use it?\r\n\r\nVue.js is used among others in apps like Xiaomi, Alibaba, Gitlab, Laracasts, Reuters, 9gag.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\nBeginner friendly,\r\nPopularity and community are rapidly growing,\r\nSimply syntax,\r\nFlexibility,\r\nTypescript support,\r\nHight performance,\r\nCons\r\n\r\nIt is not maintained by well-known companies like Google,\r\nThe youngest is from all frameworks,\r\nBeing too flexible in structure can be problematic\r\n\r\n5. jQuery\r\nI’m sure that almost everybody is familiar with jQuery, a library that has greatly facilitated JavaScript work. John Resig developed it and published in 2006, which puts it in the oldest front-end library compared to others on this list. Regardless of this, its use is still impressive today. One of the reasons we use jQuery for many years is its simplicity and minimalization in writing JavaScript code.  \r\n\r\nUnlike other frameworks and libraries, jQuery is totally beginner friendly.\r\n\r\nHow popular is?\r\n\r\nA total number of stars on GitHub is 50,928. The growth of the stars per day is constant over the year, about 8, and there are not many fluctuations. A community is enormous, and for many years in a lot of questions about the problems you can encounter during work, there are already answers.\r\n\r\nWhere is it used?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of jQuery is not like other analyzed frameworks because jQuery is primarily a library. The essence of its use is DOM and CSS manipulation, and it is mainly focused on the interactivity and functionality of the website.    Communication with server data can be accomplished by using the jQuery Ajax method. I must note that as the application grows, this library can be able to complicate the development process of the same and result in poorer performance.\r\n\r\nHowever, although jQuery is not intended to build a mobile app, it has got a new characteristic from the jQuery Mobile framework. This framework has expanded the boundaries of its use, adapted to modern requirements, but still in a far smaller percentage compared to, for example, React or Vue. Another important thing is that jQuery is abundant with plug-ins which can be of great help during your work.\r\n\r\nWhat makes jQuery special, compares to other framework and libraries, is that this library is compatible with all browsers. Unlike it, it’s often the case that other frameworks are developing quite quickly and therefore are not supported by all browsers.\r\n\r\nBig projects/companies that use it?\r\n\r\nSome companies that use jQuery are Twitter, Microsoft, Uber, Kickstarter, Pandora, SurveyMonkey.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\nBeginner friendly,\r\nCompatible with all browsers,\r\nEase of use,\r\nA lot of plugins,\r\nBig community,\r\nCons\r\n\r\njQuery can be very slow,\r\nIt is not intended to develop more complex projects,\r\nNot intended to develop mobile applications\r\n\r\n6. Ember.js\r\nAnother JavaScript framework that, because of its characteristics, deserves to be on this list is Ember. It is a component-based and 2-way-binding like Angular. Created by Yehuda Katz and published in 2011.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about the weight of learning, Ember is one of the harder frameworks to master, it’s not a flexible structure, and you will have to spend a lot of time (this is especially true for beginners). Its architecture is amazing. The thing I have to mention about the learning process itself is that Ember has one of the best documentation, which I believe can be of great help.\r\n\r\nHow popular is it?\r\n\r\nAccording to GitHub statistics, Ember has 20,637 stars and in the past year, the average growth of stars per day is 5.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has never gained popularity such as Vue, some experienced developers appreciate Ember who has met with him except other frameworks as well.\r\n\r\nWhere is it used?\r\n\r\nLike other frameworks and Ember is adapted to modern technological needs. They intend it for developing web applications and mobile app. Cordova framework is most used to create mobile applications.\r\n\r\nCompared to other frameworks, Ember is designed to fulfill the demands of very complex web applications. But, it may not be the best choice due to slow rendering.\r\n\r\nBig projects/companies that use it?\r\n\r\nCompanies using Ember are LinkedIn, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Skylight and others.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\n2-way-binding,\r\nOne of the best architectures,\r\nSuitable to develop complex applications,\r\nCons\r\n\r\nDifficult to learn,\r\nA small community\r\n\r\n7. Backbone.js\r\nVery small, organized and efficient JavaScript library. That’s Backbone.\r\n\r\nJeremy Ashkenas created this library and published in 2010. Backbone doesn’t provide data binding, and creators base its organization on the MVC principle. Since this is a library, learning is quite simple, especially with the extensive documentation it has.\r\n\r\nHow popular is it?\r\n\r\nWhen appearing to frameworks, Backbone has significantly declined popularity. Has 27,284 stars at the moment and per year it gets a one star.\r\n\r\nWhere is it used?\r\n\r\nAlthough not too popular, Backbone can have extraordinary applications for small and simple web apps. Backbone is not intended for large applications because in this case, the performance is low.\r\n\r\nBig projects/companies that use it?\r\n\r\nCompanies who use Backbone are LinkedIn Mobile, Pandora, AudioVroom.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\nBeginner friendly,\r\nGood choice for a small app,\r\nOrganized,\r\nClean,\r\nCons\r\n\r\nIt’s not a good choice for a big app,\r\nPopularity declined with emerge of frameworks\r\n', 1, '2020-06-22 14:16:00', 'https://freelancervietnam.vn/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/avatar-9.jpg'),
(10, 2, 3, '9 Tips to Run a Successful Backend Proje', 'Software development has evolved and over the years we’ve learned that software cannot be built in a silo. At TribalScale, we work closely with clients, demoing weekly releases and re-prioritizing, or even rewriting requirements to make sure we deliver the best product. This can be challenging and requires a lot of coordination between all team members. In an Agile environment, backend projects have an added level of complexity. For one, requirements change quickly and you don’t have the benefit of knowing all requirements before starting the project. Two, stakeholders don’t always have the technical knowledge needed to understand the scope of the project, especially because there are few tangible or visual components.\r\nAt TribalScale, I usually help with projects centered on backend needs. Over the years, I’ve faced many challenges and have learned many helpful lessons along the way. Below are some tips that will help with backend development and running a backend team.\r\nNote: While this is written from a consulting perspective the same approach can be applied to a product-based company. After all, at TribalScale, the client is treated as an extension of our team.\r\n1. Clarify Requirements\r\nBackend requirements tend to be technical and dense. Both the client and the Product Manager (PM) may not fully understand the pieces that need to be completed to finish a larger piece of functionality. This means that a PM needs to rely more heavily on their Engineer to break a feature down. A PM can first gather high level requirements from the client, and then take the time to break it into digestible stories with the Engineer.\r\nStory writing can be broken down into 3 steps:\r\nWith Client: Gather requirements and create high level stories.\r\nWith Engineer: Break down stories into independent chunks and write more detailed stories. At TribalScale, we like to follow the Gherkin format.\r\nWith Full Team: Have an iteration planning meeting (IPM) where assumptions and decisions made in step 2 are confirmed with the client.\r\n2. Decide on Owners (or who accepts stories)\r\nOnce a feature is broken down, stories might become too technical for the client to understand. It is important to determine which stakeholder can accept these stories. If you are working with a full-stack team it might make sense to have the frontend team accept the backend stories. The frontend team may be from the client or from your own team. It might also make sense to bring in a technical person from the client’s team to accept or validate the stories.\r\n3. Endpoint Expectations\r\nIf the client company is technical, they should have API endpoints defined and documented. However, the most disastrous backend projects tend to be those without a clear definition, or at least a vision for API endpoints. Endpoints tend to be defined ad hoc and result in a haphazard, Frankenstein-like structure.\r\nIf your team is only creating the backend, the API should be defined (endpoints, parameters, etc.) by the client, with guidance from your team. If your team is engaged to create a full stack project, the backend should be collaboratively defined by the frontend and backend teams. It is important to define these endpoints early on, so that there aren’t any surprises for either team.\r\n4. Following Standards\r\nIt is very important to have an agreed upon structure for an API endpoint. An ever-changing API is the stuff of nightmares for a frontend team. It is also important to make sure that the API is relatively flat. The deeper a frontend team needs to traverse through an API, the more likely are mistakes and bugs.\r\nHopefully the client already has standards defined for their endpoints. Just like code, it’s important that endpoints can be easily transferred to the client. This means that they should look and function like the client’s other endpoints. If the client does not follow a standard, it can be helpful to follow a predefined standard like: JSON API, or JSend.\r\nThis also means that it’s important that errors on the backend are handled consistently. To give the frontend an idea of what’s going wrong, a specific status code like 400, 404, etc., should be generated when possible. If there is a general error detected, a 500 error should be returned.\r\nIt is okay if your endpoint needs to change from time-to-time, but be sure to version them. Do this by including a version number in your endpoint path. This will allow you to update your endpoints with new versions, without breaking legacy applications that are dependant on them.\r\n5. Need for Tests\r\nBackend code lends itself well to tests. There is no visual component, so tests can solely focus on functionality. The tests should serve as a health check on the project, and as living documentation for its functionality. Other developers should be able to quickly navigate through tests and understand the purpose of a given function.\r\n6. Test Coverage\r\nThere are many test coverage tools out there. Make sure to use one that gives visibility on the number of tests being created, this gives the client an understanding of what is being created, and makes sure the Engineers keep up to date with tests.\r\nNote: It’s important to be aware that code coverage can only really help show what is not covered by the code, it will not tell you if the code is well tested or clearly tested.\r\n7. Time for Optimization\r\nDepending on client requirements, there might be a need for time to optimize the solution. Trying to optimize while creating functionality is very difficult, and can lead to very messy and coupled code. Furthermore, in an Agile environment, requirements may not be concrete. It is important to first focus on functionality and then revisit the code for refactoring and optimization. Time should be allocated to focus on optimization in the release cycle.\r\n8. Managing Client Expectations\r\nDepending on the clients background, they may or may not put an importance on backend work. Just like with any other project, it is important to give a client as much visibility as possible as to what is currently being worked on. This helps keep the client up to date with a project’s timeline, even if they are not technical.\r\n9. Portability and Dependencies\r\nBackend work tends to have a lot of dependencies. This is even more true in a microservice environment. It can sometimes be difficult to mimic the environment that the backend will eventually be deployed to. During project inception it should be determined how the backend team’s environment will be set up. Likely, the client will already have a solution for their own developers, it is important that due diligence is done to make sure this setup will work for your team.\r\nFor portability, a docker solution can help make setup time shorter in the future. This will also allow for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) setup through concourse.\r\nConclusion\r\nI hope some of my learnings and tips help you with your own project. Just like everything Agile, this is a learning process and not everything works for everyone. Are there methods that you use that weren’t mentioned? Is there something here that you disagree with?

(11, 2, 9, 'Back End Programming, indispensable job ', 'What is Back-end programming?\r\nWhen learning about the website, everyone will hear the terms \"Front End Programming\" and \"Back End Programming\". In the previous article, I explained how \"Front End Programming\" is like. In this article, we will learn Back End Programming through a familiar example that is Log in to Gmail.\r\n\r\nImagine, the entire mailbox of all Gmail customers can\'t be on your personal computer so the browser can handle it, right? Because this data is from Google, and they will put this data in a server with an Internet connection called a Web Server. Please watch the video explaining the mechanism when you visit the Gmail page and enter information to proceed to sign in.\r\nWhen you enter Gmail.com through the browser on your computer, then start typing Email and Password, finally click on the \"Sign In\" button, the browser will now send a request ( request) brings the email and password you just entered to the Web Server, where the Gmail source code resides. This is the first step when you click on the \"Sign In\" button.\r\nThe next step will be handled by Web Server, when receiving a request from the browser (Client), at this Web Server has the source code to receive Email and Password contained in the request. The simple task is to get information and query into Gmail\'s database to check if this email exists, if it exists, then check that the password is correct?\r\n\r\nThis process, the End User or we call the Visitor does not know that they do not need to do anything but the process must still run to get the desired result for the End User. This is called the Back End handler and the people who create the source code to handle the Back End are called the Back End Programmers.\r\nSo Back End Programming is simply the job of creating Back End processing code, meaning those on the Web Server side such as querying, updating data into a database or business processes that End User cannot see.\r\nAfter checking that all the information you enter is valid, then Web Server will send a response (response), which is the source code of your own Gmail website, including the mailboxes you see often. The source code for the browser to show you, you must know very well in the previous article, which is the HTML, CSS and Javascript language?', 1, '2020-06-22 10:29:00', 'https://techtalk.vn/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/backend-developer.png'),
(12, 2, 9, 'Use a back-end system suitable for games', 'Develop news site interviews experts to learn about the operation of background services and their importance.\r\n\r\nToday, almost every game has to be connected online in some parts, and even single-player is still popular, multi-user interaction, whether competitive, coordinated or just delivered. Social interaction, is also becoming increasingly popular.\r\n\r\nWith a new development model focusing on game design based on storyline and continuous updates, especially on mobile, game design is only part of the increasingly complex development process. more trash. A lot of developers now have to consider what kind of technical platform the game needs.\r\n\r\nMany companies have emerged over the years to build video game infrastructure, and often call them \"back-end as a service\" (BaaS). What does it mean?\r\n\r\nThe basic principles\r\n\"BaaS may be a misleading term,\" said John Griffin, CMO of one of the UK\'s leading service providers, GameSparks.\r\n\r\n“At GameSparks, it means giving developers everything they need from the server on the model of how much they spend. There are some important points here. The first is the scale of BaaS service delivery. Most effectively, the service needs to provide developers with a complete package of server-side components so they only need to connect to their games, shortening development time.\r\n\r\nSecond, this service should give developers control of these server components so that they do what they want, instead of being limited by our own judgment about the operation of a part. It also needs to be flexible, allowing users to build on the provided core. In addition, it also needs to minimize server administration and the underlying network layers so that developers do not have to worry about scalability, and finally, this is a service that simplifies complex online server functionality at an affordable price and is closely tied to the success of that game. ”\r\nKumakore CEO Henry Yeh also added that BaaS is currently the highest minimalist floor for game developers, using cloud computing. He explained that there are countless levels of simplification that create server-based service technology packages, such as small developers who can use their own physical servers or deploy on cloud services. like Azure or Amazon Web Services.\r\n\r\n\"With those forms, you pay directly as soon as you deploy the server, so no matter how much you use, you pay a default price to \'maintain\',\" he said.\r\n\r\n“At the next level with cloud computing, you have PaaS (Platform as a Services) services like Heroku, and they build services based on the lower tier of cloud computing, but provide their services. for developers only need to pay based on the amount of service used. And finally, BaaS, does not require any server programming knowledge, because the API has already been provided to the developer. For example, an ordinary BaaS service like Parse can be interpreted as an API for integrating MongoDB. ”\r\n\r\nCompanies in this industry provide support for a number of game features including rankings, achievement systems, money and virtual items, managing player\'s inventory, synchronized gameplay, and current information. phone alerts, statistics and chat.\r\n\r\nWhile the developer is also capable of building every service like this, Yeh believes that when players focus more on core gameplay elements, it\'s not always worth the investment of a studio. They have to rely on their own technology when there are already quite a number of service providers of this type in the market.\r\n\r\n\"They are loved by players for making good games,\" he said. “Some developers also recognize this important element that allows them to turn their passion into a successful business. No player will choose the game just because of its server services. ”', 2, '2020-06-22 22:34:00', 'https://techtalk.vn/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Orcs-Must-Die-Unchained-Fofofum.jpg'),

For example, on the face page, when you post a status, for that status to be stored, you need the backend, for that status to be displayed to your friends, you also need the backend, for that status to save react (love, indignation). wrath, woo ... haha) also need a backend ...\r\n\r\nBack End Developer decides how the website is run. Very important person.\r\nSkill Back End\r\n\r\nTo become a Back end developer, you need to know the server-side language as well as the database:\r\n\r\nServer-side language for writing back-end: C #, Java, Python, Ruby, .... Of course, there must be knowledge about the web frameworks that come with these languages: ASP.NET MVC, Spring, Django, Rails, etc.\r\nKnowledge of SQL database: MS SQL Server, MySQL, ... Recently some NoSQL databases are quite popular: Neo4j, MongoDB, ...\r\nKnowledge of the web in general, how to write Web Services, how to log in and decentralize.\r\nKnowledge of some CMS: WordPress, Joomla, Umbraco,….\r\nKnowledge of the back-end is a lot and complicated, so a back-end developer should only focus on 2-3 main languages, do not try to hug all the \"hell fire\". Back-end code is often a lot of and \"terrible\", so it needs good structure, easy to improve and expand (by applying SOLID). Back-end developers can hone their knowledge to climb the position of System Analyst or Software Architecture.', 3, '2020-06-22 22:38:00', 'https://www.searchtheweb2.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Back-End-Development.png'),

And the last one I played was called Automachef. This is a really interesting game when you arrange the automatic machines in a restaurant.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the game give you a type of food that you will use and then tell you what you need to do: the ingredients you need and the way the food is processed varies with the ingredients to get the final dish. and. You arrange these machines, each doing different things - for example, you have a conveyor belt that moves food through your machines and you put them together to create a processing line for one thing. Something that will create the dish the game requires you to make.\r\n\r\nThis is really how the algorithm works. Instead of solving the same problem with dry lines of code, you associate them with the machines in the game, you will have a more intuitive view from which to find a solution.\r\n\r\nThere are many similar games. Automachef is not the only or even the best game as far as I know. There is also a Fact Factio or Infinifactory and if you need something HIT on almost every platform, there\'s a really cool Human Resource Machine. It is available on all platforms. So if you use an iOS or Android device, tablet or phone, you can play Human Resource Machine on it.\r\n\r\nAutomachef is a great game in this genre and it is available on Steam for only $ 15.', 1, '2020-06-22 22:44:00', 'https://images.g2a.com/newlayout/323x433/1x1x0/4d7305252456/5d3967e37e696c44b1676ba3'),

It is really interesting because you will transform into this mysterious investigator. The Obra Dinn, it set sail with some cargo, but never got there and now five years later, it washed ashore, completely empty.\r\n\r\nSo, you take the role of a detective on board and investigate, find out what happened to those who set sail five years ago. And to do that, you are given a super-powerful pocket watch that allows you to turn back time to observe events when you encounter someone\'s corpse and your work using the book and fill in the name. of the dead, how they died, the crime scene, who killed them.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me a lot about debugging or when you inherit code from others. You don\'t know what is going on or how, so you just need to select a point that seems appropriate and you start investigating from there and try to understand how the rest \"fit\" like that. and in your own code case, when you\'re debugging, where the problem is, where it doesn\'t work as it should. I think The Return of the Obra Dinn has done a great job of starting and ending an interesting story and a really great graphic.\r\n\r\nThe price of Return of the Obra Dinn is $ 20 and you can own it on Steam, Switch, Playstation 4 or Xbox One.', 2, '2020-06-22 22:48:00', 'https://store.playstation.com/store/api/chihiro/00_09_000/container/US/en/999/UP2879-CUSA16867_00-ROTODBASEGAME001/1580922947000/image?w=240&h=240&bg_color=000000&opacity=100&_version=00_09_000'),

It is a really powerful tool for developers. If you use Windows, newer versions of Windows have a Linux subsystem that allows you to access Linux within Windows and so you\'ll also have access to the terminal.\r\n\r\nAlso it brings you an interesting story to explore.
